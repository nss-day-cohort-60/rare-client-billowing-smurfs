# Rare: The Publishing Platform for the Discerning Writer

This is a learning project. Our goals were to practice full stack development by creating a React client and Python-Django back end.

This project was completed in 2 agile-scrum sprints.

<!-- TODO: Finish writing the readme -->
During week one, we developed the back end using pure Python + SQL. The repo can be found here: 
https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-60/rare-python-server-glorious-g-s

We also developed the front end using React.js. The repo can be found here: 
https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-60/rare-client-glorious-gitastrophies

During week two, we re-wrote the back end using the Django framework in this current repo.
The styling in this project was implemented using Material UI. 

## Installation


1. In the terminal, run 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:nss-day-cohort-60/rare-client-billowing-smurfs.git
```
2. Move into correct directory
```bash
cd <name of folder you just created>
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
4. Run the code
```bash
npm start
```
5. This will initialize the React app in your browser, but you won't be able to log into the site or access data without running the server side of this project. To download and start the server, go to https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-60/rare-server-billowing-smurfs and follow the README there.

6. Once you are running the server, create a new user, log in to view the site, and test out the features!
